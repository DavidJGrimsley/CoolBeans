This app was created during the tutorial Coding With Chris on Youtube.
It is a menu for a coffee shop that lets you pick from several types of drinks with pictures and customize the drinks.
This project utilizes a JSON text file that has all of the coffee drinks information such as name, caffeine options, is it coffee based, etc.
This app has several different views that allow for smooth navigation.
Static examples and state properties are used in the structure of the app and view.
SwiftUI is used to show the UI.
